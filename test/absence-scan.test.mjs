// The classes it carries were extracted out of harvest-scrub-relations.test.mjs
// §6, where they assert the ABSENCE of a defect over a corpus that is clean.
// That shape cannot bite itself: a neutered predicate over a clean corpus still
// passes, so "the suite is green" says nothing about whether the extraction
// kept the classes alive. What proves a class alive is a SEEDED defect — one
// synthetic document per class, each of which must produce exactly its own
// finding. That is what the first section does, and it is the guarantee the
// extraction needed.
//
// The rest exercises the CLI contract the pre-push hook in the dotfiles repo
// depends on: exit 2 on findings, 0 on clean, the git-range mode over a real
// scratch repository, the allowlist, and the degraded (unparseable) path.
//
// Every identifier here is synthetic — this repo is public.

// test file's evidence comment and in tools/replay.mjs — public repo,
// unscrubbable history). A bare "no UUIDs in source" rule would fire on the
// synthetic ones, so the rule is: every UUID in test/, tools/, and proxy/
// source is on the explicit synthetic allowlist below, or this test fails. A
// new legitimate synthetic is added HERE, deliberately, in the same diff a
// reviewer sees — never waved through.
//
// docs/ IS THE SAME SURFACE (widened 2026-08-01, BACKLOG "docs/ UUID triage"):
// a directive, a review or a release-test log is as public as a source file,
// and the same sweep found real capture keys and a session id sitting in four
// of them. Prose carries more legitimate synthetics than code does — hence the
// provenance line on each entry below.
// The roster MOVED to tools/absence-scan.mjs on 2026-08-15 so the scanner
// itself can honour it (test/absence-scan-synthetic-roster.test.mjs). It is
// imported rather than re-declared: two copies of a declaration is two
// truths, and the roster test below is the half that keeps this one honest.

// under `tools/`. That left `BACKLOG.md` and `FORK-NOTES.md` unchecked, which
// are the two fork-only root documents and the two that discuss captures most
// (BACKLOG.md alone carries ~185 alias citations).
//
// Why that was load-bearing rather than untidy: `tools/absence-scan.mjs`'s
// `FULL_UUID_HEAD` SUPPRESSES the short-key class on any line containing a
// full 8-4-4-4-12 UUID, deferring that shape to "the source-UUID roster the
// suite already walks" — this test. For a file the roster did not walk, the
// deferral pointed at nobody: writing the FULL id disabled the guard that
// catches the SHORT one. Measured on the real scanner:
// `scanContent("… dc3f8071-8555-…", "BACKLOG.md")` -> 0 findings, while the
// short form on the same file -> 1. Found by leaking a real published session
// id into BACKLOG.md while writing the backlog entry about that very class;
// a grep on the diff caught it, no mechanism did.
//
// `git ls-files` rather than a wider readdir, for three reasons: it cannot
// silently miss a new directory the way a hand-listed root set does; it is
// the same tree-derived enumeration `test/logs-schemas.test.mjs:340` uses, so
// the repo has one way of asking "every source file"; and it excludes
// UNTRACKED files, which is correct — untracked scratch is not published, and
// three root-level dossier files on this machine carry real registered
// capture ids right now. Those are not findings while they stay untracked,
// and they become findings the moment anyone commits them, which is exactly
// when this test should fire.
//
// Measured rather than assumed, because the first draft of this comment said
// they were "one `git add` away": `git check-ignore` says all three ARE
// ignored, so a plain `git add` cannot stage them and only `-f` would. The
