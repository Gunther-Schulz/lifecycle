# Migration report — BACKLOG.md → ITEMS.md (2026-08-26)

Produced by `lifecycle migrate`. **A DRY RUN**: the source carriers `BACKLOG.md` and `NONE` were READ. They are not edited, not moved and not deleted, and retiring them is a separate act after a human has read this file.

This report DESCRIBES entries — line number, grade word, rule applied. It does not quote their prose.

## Reconciliation

| quantity | count |
|---|---|
| top-level bullets in `BACKLOG.md` | 8 |
| of those, ENTRIES (bold, or led by a grade-shaped word) | 8 |
| of those, non-entry prose bullets (not migrated) | 0 |
| of those, bullets in a section §4 row 1 CUTS | 0 |
| items written to `ITEMS.md` | 8 |
| entries reported UNCLASSIFIED (not written) | 0 |
| archive bodies in `ITEMS-DONE.md` (verbatim) | 0 |
| entries routed to the ledger | 0 |

**Identity:** 8 entries read = 8 written + 0 unclassified — HOLDS.

**Bullet identity:** 8 top-level bullets = 8 entries + 0 prose + 0 cut — HOLDS. This is the identity that makes 'not migrated' visible: every bullet in the source is in exactly one of the three columns, so a bullet the migration simply did not see would show up as a gap in the sum rather than as nothing at all.

**Conservation (§3.1), computed on the produced files:** items 8 + done 0 = 8; baseline 8 + added 0 − compacted 0 = 8. HOLDS.

The bullet count and the archive count use DIFFERENT notions of an entry, deliberately and not accidentally: the archive count is `items_mod.archive_entries`, every line opening `- ` in the archived body, which is the notion the conservation identity uses on both sides of the migration. The entry count above is the migration's own notion. Where the two differ over the same file, the difference is sub-bullets at column zero and is not a lost body.

## The MIGRATION WRITE-RULES (§3.1, blocking and fixed)

**No migrated entry inherits READY.** READY is the desk's judgment that a fresh context could execute an item now, made about a carrier that no longer exists. Every entry below is written NEW.

**Every migrated OPEN entry carries a TYPED blocker.** The typing is the rule, not a detail: "every migrated item is blocked" is satisfied by prose, and prose sits in nobody's court — which is the entry that ages out silently. The three branches:

| branch | blocker | why |
|---|---|---|
| old READY / RECORD | `decision` | the grade returns to the desk for a re-grade; it is not inherited |
| PARKED carrying its named missing evidence | `evidence` | it is already in the MACHINE's court, and converting it to a decision would move a waiting item into the operator's queue for no reason |
| slot-incomplete (everything else) | `decision` | NEW with a decision naming what the desk must supply — never `NONE` |

**Blockers written, PER TYPE.** A total is the number that hides the untyped one, so there is no total here:

| blocker type | entries |
|---|---|
| `decision` | 5 |
| `evidence` | 3 |
| `item-id` | 0 |
| `NONE` | 0 |
| `untyped` | 0 |

`untyped` and `NONE` are both **0**, and either being non-zero is a finding rather than a statistic. Under the closed goal vocabulary nearly every migrated open item is slot-incomplete anyway, so the `decision` count will LOOK like "all" — which is precisely why the criterion is stated per type.

**The done home holds no blocker.** The write-rules are about OPEN items; a blocker in the closure home is a shape finding, not a migration output. This migration writes nothing into the done home but the verbatim archive, so the property holds by construction — and it is CHECKED by the done home's own shape check rather than assumed.

## Grade-word rules (design §4 row 1, §3.1)

These classify the SOURCE word — which entries are entries and which are unclassifiable. The resulting grade is then overridden to NEW by the write-rules above; the mapping is kept because it decides UNCLASSIFIED, and because a reader needs to see which word each entry carried.

| source grade word | §4 row 1 says | after the §3.1 write-rules |
|---|---|---|
| `READY` | READY | NEW — §4 row 1: READY→READY (scheduled by cap/head-rule at read time, not by this migration) |
| `RECORD` | READY | NEW — §4 row 1: RECORD→READY-unscheduled; §3.1: the rest are READY and visible, not a separate word |
| `PARKED` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: PARKED→PARKED with a typed blocker, or NEW |
| `HANDOFF` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `OPEN` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1 and §3.1: OPEN→NEW |
| `BUST` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `PARTLY` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `CANDIDATE` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `FINDING` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `NEW` | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: →NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| `POINTER` | NEW | NEW — §3.1: POINTER → an item whose body lives elsewhere, referenced |
| (ungraded) | NEW | NEW — §4 row 1: ungraded → NEW with a typed blocker or DROPPED |
| anything else | — | **UNCLASSIFIED**, reported with its grade word and line number (D-f). Never guessed. |

## Outcome per class

| source grade word | → | entries |
|---|---|---|
| `PARKED` | NEW | 7 |
| `READY` | READY | 1 |

## Entries by source section

| section | entries |
|---|---|
| lifecycle — backlog | 0 |
| Open | 8 |

## UNCLASSIFIED — findings for the desk

None.

## What this migration does NOT carry, named rather than discovered

- **`goal`, `done-criterion` and `evidence` have no rule in §4 row 1.** Only the write-set does ("write-set absent → UNKNOWN"). A slot cannot be empty, so `goal` and `done-criterion` are written `UNKNOWN` at the same width the design gives the write-set, and `evidence` carries the source line range in `BACKLOG.md`. The design gap is reported, not closed here.
- **The PARKED branch of §4 row 1 is unreachable over this carrier.** "PARKED→PARKED with a typed blocker or NEW" turns on a typed blocker, and the old carrier has no blocker slot; no rule in the design derives one from a body. Every PARKED entry therefore takes the NEW branch, and the parked-ness — which court the item waits in — is not carried across. That is the largest single information loss in this migration and it is a decision for the desk, not for the tool.
- **A NARRATIVE section's bold bullets migrate as items, because §4 row 1 states no rule that stops them.** The rule list covers grade words and "ungraded", and a handoff paragraph's bullet is ungraded — so it becomes a NEW item. Only `## Grades` is CUT by name. The per-section table above is where this is visible: a section whose heading is a status narrative rather than a queue contributed entries, and whether that is wanted is the desk's call, not a rule this tool may invent.
- **Live entry BODIES are not carried.** An item's slots are one line each; the old entries are paragraphs. In this DRY RUN the bodies stay in `BACKLOG.md`, and git keeps them either way — but a later act that retires the old carrier drops them to history, and that is worth deciding rather than discovering.

## Ledger

`LEDGER.md` holds 0 line(s). Nothing migrates into the ledger (§3.6, §4 row 1); the acceptance criterion is that this number is zero, and it is printed as a number because "nothing migrated" and "nothing was counted" read the same in prose.
