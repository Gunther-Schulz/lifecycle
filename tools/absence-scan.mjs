// absence-scan — the fixture hygiene classes, as an importable scanner and a
// CLI, so they can run where the exposure actually is.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The classes below were written as assertions inside
// test/harvest-scrub-relations.test.mjs §6 and fire at TEST time. The cost
// they guard against is paid at PUSH time: a harvested fixture carrying
// capture identifiers reached a public PR, and public git history cannot be
// scrubbed afterwards (the remediation for a leaked origin IP in a sibling
// repo was recreating the host). A check that only runs when someone runs the
// suite is not in front of that boundary. This file is the same check, made
// runnable by the pre-push hook the dotfiles repo deploys — the manual
// finding is the prototype, the mechanism is the deliverable
// (docs/dev-loop.md, "Adding a check").
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. This is an EXTRACTION, not a redesign. Every predicate here
// is the one §6 encoded on 2026-07-31; nothing was tightened and nothing was
// loosened. The classes' DEFINITION is
// docs/directives/fixture-sanitization-directive.md ("Threat model" + settled
// designs 2 and 5), restated in §6 and restated again here — deliberately not
// read back out of tools/harvest.mjs, because an expectation with the same
// parentage as the code pins the bug it should catch.
//
// FINDINGS NEVER ECHO THE MATCH. A leak reporter that prints the leak into a
// terminal, a CI log or a hook transcript has moved the leak, not found it. A
// finding carries the class, the file, the JSON path that reaches the string,
// lengths, and a HASHED identity (see "Finding identity"). Never the bytes.
//
// THE THIRD ANSWER (docs/dev-loop.md, "A checker has THREE answers"): a file
// that does not parse is neither silently skipped nor silently passed — it is
// scanned as raw bytes (so the two byte-level classes still apply) and named
// on a `degraded:` line, so a run that could not fully verify says so.

//
// Lives here rather than in either caller, so the test and the push hook
// cannot drift apart on what is accepted.
//
// LEDGER-*.json is the per-machine harvest watermark ledger. The exemption
// covers ONE class: `live-timestamp`, which fires on its `lastHarvest` fields.
// Those ARE the file's content — a watermark ledger whose watermarks were
// scrubbed would not be one.
//
// NARROWED 2026-08-05, because the old wording ("keyed by raw capture key BY
// DESIGN") read as though the exemption also blessed the identifiers, and for
// months everyone including this comment's author took it that way. It never
// did — the ids were invisible for an unrelated reason (object KEY names were
// not scanned at all), so nothing ever tested the assumption. 94 full session
// identifiers sat in this tracked, public file.
//
// Both halves are fixed rather than exempted: keys are hashed at the source
// (harvest.mjs `ledgerKey`), and key names are now scanned. What remains here
// is only the timestamps, which is what a residual should look like — one
// named class, with a reason that survives being read carefully.
// Entries are {pattern, classes}: which CLASSES a path is exempt from, never
// the whole file. A path-wide exemption is a hole with a comment on it — it
// hides every class, including ones nobody had thought about when the
// exemption was written, and it is exactly how this file's own ledger kept 94
// session identifiers out of sight. `classes: "all"` remains expressible but
// nothing uses it, deliberately.
//
// rowpins/ — the daily sweep's row evidence pins (gate-live.mjs). Same ONE
// class and the same reason as the ledger above: the instant a pin carries is
// its join to the bust ledger, i.e. the artifact's content rather than a
// residue of one. Scoped to the DIRECTORY, so a pin that ever carried a
// session id, a capture key or unscrubbed text still fires — the pins' own
// suite asserts both halves, that live-timestamp is exempt here and that
// nothing else is.
//
// Added 2026-08-07 on an operator correction. It shipped hours earlier at day
// precision with the hour-join written down as a named residual, and this
// session then recommended leaving it "until a join actually needs the hour" —
// which is the deferral the dev-loop's standing tooling rule now forbids by
// name, since booking it cost what building it cost.

// WHY IT EXISTS. The push hook discards findings the other side demonstrably
// already has — blocking them buys nothing, and the `--no-verify` habit it
// trains is the actual damage. Until 2026-08-08 it asked that question of the
// whole BLOB: is this path's blob byte-identical to a published one? Editing
// the file mints a new blob, so a months-old, already-public finding inside it
// read as NEW on every subsequent push, forever. Measured 2026-08-07 on
// claude-worktime.sh: two capture-key-prefix findings whose lines have been
// public since long before, blocking every future edit of that file. This
// identity moves the question down one level, from the file to the finding.
//
// HASHED, NEVER PRINTED — the same rule the rest of this file follows (see the
// header), and the same one the hook's `_nachricht_hash` already applies to
// commit messages. An identity that echoed its match would move the leak into
// every terminal, transcript and CI log the hook writes to.
//
// THE BYTES ARE THE FINDING'S OWN UNIT — the same span its `length` measures:
// the whole source LINE for capture-key-prefix, the whole string VALUE for a
// document class, the basename for the filename class. Deliberately the wider
// span rather than the regex match: `scanSourceText` emits ONE finding per
// line however many keys that line carries, so an identity keyed on the match
// alone would answer "already published" for a line that has just gained a
// fresh identifier next to an old one. The wider unit fails closed — any edit
// to the flagged span mints a new identity, and the finding blocks again.

// --- one published version of a path -----------------------------------------

/**
 * The findings of `paths` AS THEY STAND AT `ref` — content out of git, but
 * classified under each path's own LOGICAL name, so the allowlist, the
 * class-scoped exemptions and the harvested-corpus scope rule all decide
 * exactly what they decide in `--git-range`. Reusing `scanContent` rather than
 * re-deriving the classification is the point: a second reading of "what is a
 * finding here" would drift from this one silently (docs/dev-loop.md, "Never
 * hand-roll identity in a probe").
 *
 * The caller is the push hook, asking what a path's ALREADY PUBLISHED versions
 * carry, so it can discard exactly those findings from the push it is scanning.
 *
 * `ref` is a commit-ish: content comes from `git show <ref>:<path>`. A path
 * that does not resolve there contributes NOTHING and is named on a
 * `degraded:` line — the fail-closed direction, because a version that could
 * not be read must not read as "carries no findings" (docs/dev-loop.md, "A
 * checker has THREE answers"). The hook's own walk only ever passes versions
 * it has already resolved, so this is the safety net rather than the path.
